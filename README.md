Total Cases vs Population: Compares total cases to population, calculating the percentage of the population infected with COVID-19 over time.
Total Death Count by Location: Aggregates the total death count for each location, providing insight into the impact of COVID-19 on different regions.
Countries with Highest Infection Rate Compared to Population: Identifies countries with the highest infection rates relative to their populations.
Countries with Highest Death Count per Population: Finds the continents with the highest death counts per population, offering insights into the severity of the pandemic across different regions.
Global Numbers: Calculates global COVID-19 statistics, including total cases, total deaths, and the percentage of deaths relative to total cases.
Total Population vs Vaccination: Calculates the percentage of the population that has been vaccinated against COVID-19, considering total population and vaccination data.
Creating View for Visualization Data: Creates a view named percentpopnvaccinated, which combines COVID-19 cases and vaccination data for later visualization.
Temporary Table Creation: Creates a temporary table named percentpopulationvaccinated to store combined COVID-19 cases and vaccination data for further analysis.
